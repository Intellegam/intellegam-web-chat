High Priority:
  1. Transaction Support: Wrap user operations in database transactions
  2. Rate Limiting: Add rate limiting to webhook endpoint to prevent abuse
  3. Event Deduplication: Store processed event IDs to prevent replay attacks
  4. Better Error Handling: The ensureUserExists ON CONFLICT clause needs the unique constraint to work properly (now fixed)

  Medium Priority:
  1. Webhook Event Logging: Create audit trail table for processed events
  2. Monitoring: Add alerts for webhook failures and sync issues
  3. Retry Mechanism: Implement exponential backoff for failed sync operations
  4. Email Updates: Handle user email changes via webhooks

  Testing Improvements:
  1. Add integration tests with real database
  2. Test concurrent webhook scenarios
  3. Test rollback scenarios
  4. Add performance tests for bulk webhook processing
